FedPredict is a personalization plugin for Federated Learning (FL) methods. It allows clients to collaboratively learn from each other without losing personalization in the local data. How it works? FedPredict intelligently combines global and local model parameters. In this process, it assigns more or less weight to each type of parameter according to various factors, such as the evolution level (el) of the global model, the update level (ul) of the local model, and the similarity (s) between the old data (i.e., the one in which the model was previously trained) and the recently acquired data). Then, the client uses the combined model to make predictions over the test/val data. Benefits The list of benefits of the plugin as listed as follows: High accuracy : it pushes up FL accuracy without requiring additional training! Support for dynamic data : it is designed for stationary and non-stationary non-IID data. Concept drift : FedPredict makes the model almost instantly adapt to the new scenario when concept drift occurs. Task independent : apply FedPredict for any type of deep neural network task. Easy to use : no modifications are necessary in the training stage of your solution! Low computational cost : it is composed of simple operations. Just plug and play! Installation FedPredict is compatible with Python 3.9 and is tested on the latest versions of Ubuntu. With your virtual environment opened, type the following command to install FedPredict from Pypi: pip install fedpredict To install from Google Colab: ! pip install fedpredict FL requirements In general, if your solution shares some level of similarity with FedAvg, then FedPredict is ready to use. The requirements are described as follows: Sharing all layers . The clients have to upload all model layers at every round so the server can aggregate a global model that can be directly leveraged by a new client, as in FedAvg. Same model structure . The layers of the global and local models have to have the same shape to allow the combination of parameters. Predicting using the combined model . On the client side, the original method has to be flexible enough to make predictions based on the combined model; otherwise, the plugin will have no effect.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-fedpredict","text":"","title":"Welcome to FedPredict"},{"location":"#the-very-first-federated-learning-plugin","text":"FedPredict is a personalization plugin for Federated Learning (FL) methods.
