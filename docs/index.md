# Welcome to FedPredict
## The first-ever plugin for Federated Learning!

**FedPredict** is a Federated Learning (FL) plugin designed to enhance existing FL solutions without requiring additional training or computational overhead.
It enables personalization in standard algorithms such as FedAvg and FedYogi, boosting performance in scenarios with non-IID data.

As a modular component, FedPredict operates exclusively during the prediction phase of FL and does not require any modifications to the training process.

This project has been developed through a collaboration between the **WISEMAP Lab (UFMG)**, **H.IAAC Lab (UNICAMP)**, and **NESPED Lab (UFV)**.
